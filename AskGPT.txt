Hi gpt. did you know i am a fan of 3d printing and have a Creality ender 3 printer? I love making stuff, specially gifts for my friends in the congregation and family.

so i am in need of a solution for a problem i face. i will use this opportunity to upgrade my programming and tech skills.
I print some portraits with the 3d printer and using color gradng i change image to grayscale image and then i convert that image to stl. it gives me heights for each color level and i use black, gray silver  white.. etc.. colors for each set of level, i use one color. i provide you an example i did.. tell me... how is it!!! :D

now what i want is for a given image, i need to separate image to few colors. there can be 2 options
1. i give how many colors, and depending on the grayscale/color levels, the program automatically roundup the image to those colors..
2. i give howmany colors, and i get to choose the color each by each. then program analyze the image and roundup the image pixels to given colors by detecting given color values; there i should be able to select each color with color pallet and/or i should be able to give the #hex value for the colors i need. 

i would like to use js/nodejs/python for this project in that order of priority..
Can you help me? thanks

you are a highly intelligent top %0.0001 python developer and a highly intelligent top %0.0001 git hub specialist.
I am going to upload this project to github.
take me through the process. 
also improve this program and make professional. 
one point that it can be improved is the tab/option 2. i give how many colors, and i get to choose the color each by each.
in this case the existing program chooses the closest colors and represent the imge with it. but whai i want is, if i select 5 colors, i need the program to divide the image to 5 colors (closer), and represent the image with 5 selected colors. because i use this program to see how it will tourn out to be an image turn in to 3 d print with color filaments i have
